/*INSTRUCTIONS:
BankAccount Assignment
We are going to create a BankAccount class. This class will recreate some of the common account transactions that normally occur for a bank account such as displaying your account number, checking and savings amount, total amount. Of course, there are also methods to invoke, such as depositing a check, checking your balance, withdrawing money.

Objectives:
-Practice member variables
-Practice instance methods and getter and setters
-Implement static variables and methods.

Tasks:
-Create a BankAccount class.
-The class should have the following attributes: (string) account number, (double) checking balance, (double) savings balance.
-Create a class member (static) that has the number of accounts created thus far.
-Create a class member (static) that tracks the total amount of money stored in every account created.
-Create a private method that returns a random ten digit account number.
-In the constructor, call the private method from above so that each user has a random ten digit account.
-In the constructor, be sure to increment the account count.
-Create a getter method for the user's checking account balance.
-Create a getter method for the user's saving account balance.
-Create a method that will allow a user to deposit money into either the checking or saving, be sure to add to total amount stored.
-Create a method to withdraw money from one balance. Do not allow them to withdraw money if there are insufficient funds.
-Create a method to see the total money from the checking and saving.
-Users should not be able to set any of the attributes from the class.*/
